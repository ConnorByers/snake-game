# snake-game
Copy of the classic Snake game using C++ and SFML 2.5

To move the snake, use WASD or Arrow Keys

Player starts off as a 1 unit snake, which is the colour white, and they move around in a grid to hit(eat) the food, which is green.

If they hit the wall or themselves, the game is over.

Changed the necessary length to win to 50 to make it easier to win.
